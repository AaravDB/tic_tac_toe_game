# Tic Tac Toe — Minimal Web Game

A small, single-page Tic Tac Toe game built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

**Project Overview**
- **Purpose**: A compact, easy-to-read implementation of Tic Tac Toe intended for learning, experimentation, and quick demos.
- **Structure**: Static front-end files (HTML/CSS/JS) provide the game board, simple UI, and game logic.

**Features Implemented**
- **Two-player local play**: Two people can play on the same device.
- **Basic bot opponent**: A simple computer opponent is included so you can play solo. It is rudimentary and intended as a convenience rather than a strong AI.
- **Responsive layout**: Basic adjustments for smaller screens to keep the board usable on phones.
- **Clear, minimal UI**: Focus on readability and straightforward game flow.

**Why I Made It**
- **Learn and iterate**: I built this  to improve on an earlier Tic Tac Toe project that had notable shortcomings.
- **Address one limitation**: The earlier version lacked any bot — this project adds a simple computer opponent so a single player can play alone.

**Limitations**
- **Not production-ready or scalable**: This is a small, single-page app with no backend or persistence.
- **No game modes or difficulty levels**: The bot does not support multiple difficulty settings.
- **No online or networked multiplayer**: Play is local only.
- **No persistent score tracking or player profiles**: Closing the page resets all progress.
- **Limited accessibility features and mobile refinements**: Further work is needed to improve keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and touch ergonomics.
- **No undo/redo or move history**: Moves cannot be reverted once made.
- **Minimal testing and no CI setup**: Development and testing are manual.
- **Bot quality**: The included bot is simple and may play suboptimally in many situations.
